## ML projects on tensorflow

### Environment set up
In the terminal run <b>poetry install</b>, after the installer finishes, run <b>poetry shell</b> and then <b>pip install tensorflow</b> to add tensorflow in the environment.

Everything was run on my personal machine, with CPU: ryzen 7 3700x, GPU: rtx 2060 super

Each folder contains projects on the corresponding subject (for example <i>computer vision</i> folder contains <b>computer vision projects</b>)
